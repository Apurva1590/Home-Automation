# Home-Automation
This is a guide on how to automate a couple of things around you(lights, lamps etc.) 

Hardware required: Raspberry pi Relay( Number of channels depends on you) Jumper cables (female to female) SD card (for your Raspberry Pi)

Note: I have a mac so I'll be guiding you using that, you can find help online if you have a PC.

Setup:
Download Raspbian on your sd card and plug it in your raspberry pi. If you dont know how to do that, here is a good tutorial: https://medium.com/a-swift-misadventure/setup-your-raspberry-pi-2-3-with-raspbian-headless-without-cables-c78309fd7045#.of4kc99qq
This tutorial lets use the raspberryb pi using the terminal(SSH), but if you prefer to use the GUI, the you can use the VNC server. It's very simple to set it up, here is a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QCoh8S0N4&t=121s

We've now setup the OS on the raspberry pi. 
We are going to install node
